# Newbie Engine
Can one undergraduate student make a fully-functional game engine? Let's try answering to this question.

## Goal
* Study and research about how the game engine is built in general.
* Come up with abstractions such as Project, Scene, GameObject, Renderer, Collider and many more.
* Make a GUI editor that allows users to inspect and modify objects handily.
* Create a simple 3D game with this engine. 

## Feature

## Build
* Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
* Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/). 
* Open **Windows Command Prompt**
* Type **cd c:/**/**cd /** in Windows/Unix.
* Type **git clone https://github.com/anybirds/Newbie**
* Type **cd Newbie**
* Type **setup.bat**/**setup.sh** in Windows/Unix.
* Open **c:/Newbie/Build/Editor/Editor.sln**/**/Newbie/Build/Editor/Editor.sln** in Windows/Unix.
* Run in **Release** mode.
