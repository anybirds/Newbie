# Newbie Engine
Can one undergraduate student make a fully-functional game engine? Let's do this.

## Goal
* Study and research about how the game engine is built in general.
* Come up with abstractions such as Project, Scene, GameObject, Renderer, Collider and many more.
* Make a GUI editor that allows users to inspect and modify objects handily.
* Create a simple 3D game with this engine. 

## Feature
